### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Martin, but my family and friends call me just Tin. I'm a seasoned python developer (altought my linkedin profile says I'm still a "semi junior"). I'm from Argentina. 
Interested in several topics, including open data, web development, dev tools, politics, history, writing, gardening, sports and more.  

Currently enjoying the journey as a [hero](https://shiphero.com), and not looking for a new position.
